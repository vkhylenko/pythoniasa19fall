        # Python Used for:

        - Data Science
        - ERP/MRP
        - Web Development
        - Robotics and Devices
        - DevOps Automation
        - Everyday general purpose automation language

        # History

        - Conceptualized by Guido van Rossum in late 80s
        - Named after comedy series "Monty Python's Flying Circus"
        - Releases:
            - 0.9.0 – February 1991
            - 1.0 – January 1994
            - 2.0 – October 2000
            - 3.0 – December 2008
            - *"There should be one – and preferably only one – obvious way to do it."*
        - Don't use Python 2 anymore, it's finally a legacy.

        # Python Overview

        - Python is a **high-level**, **interpreted**, **interactive** and **object-oriented** **scripting language**.
        - Python is designed to be **highly readable**.
        - Python uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation,
            and it has **fewer syntactical constructions** than other languages.

        ---

        # Python Features

        - **Interpreted Language**. Python is processed at runtime by interpreter.
        - **Object-Oriented Language**. It supports object-oriented features and techniques of programming.
        - **Interactive Language**. Users can interact with the python interpreter directly for writing programs.
        - **Easy Language**. Python is easy to learn especially for beginners.
        - **Straightforward Syntax**. The formation of python syntax is simple and straightforward which also makes it popular.
        - **Easy to Read**. Python code is clearly defined and visible to the eyes.
        - **Portable**. Python codes can be run on a wide variety of hardware platforms having the same interface.
        - **Extendable**. Users can add low level-modules to Python interpreter.
        - **Scalable**. Python provides an improved structure for large programs.
        - **Parallel**. Write multithreading and multiprocessing programs.

        # Python Interpreter

        ```
        $ python3
        Python 3.7.4 (v3.7.4:e09359112e, Jul  8 2019, 14:54:52)
        [Clang 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin
        Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
        >>>
        ```

        Exit Python Interpreter:
        - `exit()`
        - Ctrl+D

        # Python Script

        Plain text file in UTF-8.

        ```
        $ python3 filename.py
        ```

        # Python Syntax: Variables

        ```python
        >>> x = 100
        >>> s = 'Hello'

        >>> variable_name = [x, s]

        >>> print(variable_name)
        [100, 'Hello']

        >>> variable_name
        [100, 'Hello']
        ```

        ---

        # Python Syntax: String Literals

        - Single or double quoted (single quoted preferred), escape characters:
            ```python
            >>> print('"I\'m double quoted"')
            "I'm double quoted"
            >>> print("'I'm single quoted'")
            'I'm single quoted'
            ```

        - Multiline strings enclosed with `'''` or `"""`:
            ```python
            >>> s = '''long
            ... multiline
            ... string'''
            ```

        - Use f-strings for formatting, expressions are automatically converted:
            ```python
            >>> x = 300
            >>> f'{x} Spartans'
            '300 Spartans'
            >>> f'{x + 100} Spartans'
            '400 Spartans'
            ```

        - In the face of ambiguity, *refuse* the temptation to guess.
        - There should be one — and preferably *only one* — obvious way to do it.
        - **Now** is better than **never**.
        - Although **never** is often better than **right now**.
        - If the implementation is *hard* to explain, it's a bad idea.
        - If the implementation is easy to explain, it *may* be a good idea.
        - Namespaces are one honking great idea — let's do more of those!
