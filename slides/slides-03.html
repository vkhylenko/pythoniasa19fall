        # Lines, Explicit and Implicit Line joining

        - Logical lines
        - Physical lines

        ```python
        x = 1
        z = a + 1000 \
            + 2000 + 3000
        s = '''This is
        a long line of text'''
        y = (
            100,
            200,
            )
        ```

        9 physical lines, 4 logical lines

        ```python
        x = 100; y = 200
        ```

        1 physical, 1 logical

        # Python Syntax Elements

        - Encoding declaration
        - Comments
        - Docstrings (special case of string literal)
        - Blank lines
        - Indentation
        - Whitespace between tokens
        - **Keywords**
        - **Identifiers**
            - Reserved classes of identifiers
        - **Literals**
        - **Operators**
        - **Delimiters**

        ---

        # Encoding declaration

        First or second line in file:

        ```python
        # -*- coding: <encoding-name> -*-
        ```

        ```python
        # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
        ```
        ---

        # Comments

        - No block comments
        - Everything after `#`

        ```python
        # single line comment
        ```

        ```python
        x = 100  # inline comment, 2 spaces after the code by convention
        ```

        ---

        # Docstrings

        - Introduced in [PEP-257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)
        - Special case of string literal used for documentation.
        - Becomes part of function/class declaration.

        ```python
        def fibonacci(n):
            """Generate n-th Fibonacci number."""
        ```

        ```python
        def func():
            """
            Multiline docstring.
            """
        ```

        ```python
        class Point:
            """Base point class in N-dimensional Euclidean space."""
        ```

        ```python
        fibonacci.__doc__
        func.__doc__
        Point.__doc__
        ```

        ---

        # Indentation

        - Indentation consists of spaces and tabs (not recommended); mixing is not recommended
        - Indentation starts at the beginning of the line and can't be split over multipe physical lines with `\`
        - Recommended: 4 spaces
        - Wrong indentation raises error

        ---

        # Indentation, Correct

        Example of correct (but strange) indentation:

        ```python
        def perm(l):
                # Compute the list of all permutations of l
            if len(l) <= 1:
                          return [l]
            r = []
            for i in range(len(l)):
                     s = l[:i] + l[i+1:]
                     p = perm(s)
                     for x in p:
                      r.append(l[i:i+1] + x)
            return r
        ```

        ---

        # Indentation, Incorrect

        Example of incorrect indentation:

        ```python
         def perm(l):                       # error: first line indented
        for i in range(len(l)):             # error: not indented
            s = l[:i] + l[i+1:]
                p = perm(l[:i] + l[i+1:])   # error: unexpected indent
                for x in p:
                        r.append(l[i:i+1] + x)
                    return r                # error: inconsistent dedent
        ```

        ---

        # Whitespaces Between Tokens

        - Whitespaces are used to separate tokens
        - Whitespace is needed between two tokens only if their concatenation could otherwise be interpreted as a different token:
            `ab` vs. `a b`.
        - Whitespace characters can be used interchangeably: space, tab formfeed
            -  except at the beginning of a logical line or in string literals

        # 35 Keywords (Python 3.7.4)


        .pull-left[
        - True, False, None
        - and, or, not, is, in
        - as
        - assert
        - async, await
        - class, def, lambda
        - del
        - for, while, break, continue
        ]
        .pull-right[
        - global, nonlocal
        - if, elif, else
        - import, from
        - pass
        - raise, try, except, finally
        - return, yield
        - with

        # Identifiers

        - **Case sensitive**
        - ASCII characters: `a`-`z`, `A`-`Z`, `_`, and `0`-`9` (except the first character)
        - Unicode characters: [PEP-3131](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3131/),
            full list [see here](https://www.dcl.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/home/loewis/table-3131.html)

        Examples:

        ```python
        >>> name = 1
        >>> Name = 2
        >>> name, Name
        (1, 2)
        >>> 䜃 = 1
        >>> я_плакал = 987
        >>> _ = 100500
        ```

        ```python
        >>> 1Name
          File "<stdin>", line 1
            1Name
                ^
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax
        ```

        ---

        # Identifiers: Naming Conventions

        - Mostly lowercase
        - Keep names as short as possible, but preserve readability and make self-descriptive names
        - `snake_case` over `camelCase`
        - Functions, variables, class members: `lowercase_snake_case`
        - Class names: `FirstLetterUppercaseCamelCase`
        - Constants: `UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE`

        ---

        # Identifiers: Reserved

        - `_`
            - in the interactive interpreter, the result of last evaluation
        - `_*`
            - hidden names: not imported by `from module import *`
            - protected class members (convention)
        - `__*`
            - implementation of "protected" methods in Python
        - `__*__`
            - [special method names](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#specialnames)
            - special module variables (convention):
                `__author__`, `__copyright__`, `__license__`, `__version__`, etc.

        # Literals

        - String, bytes
        - Number:
            - Integer
            - Floating-point
            - Imaginary
        - See [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#literals)

        **Note:** `True`, `False`, `None` – are **keywords**, although they are used like literals.

        ---

        # Operators

        - Arithmetic: `+` `-` `*` `**` `/` `//` `%` `@`
        - Bitwise: `<<` `>>` `&` `|` `^` `~`
        - Logical: `<` `>` `<=` `>=` `==` `!=`

        **Note:** `and`, `or`, `not` – are **keywords**, although they act like logical operators.

        Python supports operators overloading.

        # Delimiters

        - `(` `)` `[` `]` `{` `}`
        - `.`
        - `,` `:` `;`
        - `@`
        - `->`
        - `=`
        - `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `//=`, `%=`, `@=`, `&=`, `|=`, `^=`, `>>=`, `<<=`, `**=`
